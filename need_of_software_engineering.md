<br/>

- **Large Software:** It is easier to build a wall than make a house or building, likewise, as the size of software become *large engineering* has to step to give it a *science process*.

- **Scability:** If the software were not based on *scientific and engineering concepts*, it was easier to re-create new software than to *scale* an existentt one.

- **Cost:** As hardware industry has shown its *skills and huge manufacturing* has lower down the *price of computer* and electronic *hardware*. But the cost of *software* remains high if proper process is not adapted.

- **Dynamic Nature:** The always growing and adapting nature of software hugely depends upon the environment in which the user works.

- **Quality Management:** Better process of software development provides better and
quality software product.
