# Heuristic Techniques 🤔🎓

Heuristic techniques are problem-solving approaches that leverage experience, intuition, and common sense to find practical solutions, often in situations where exhaustive search methods are impractical.

## What are Heuristic Techniques? 🤔🧠

Heuristic techniques are methods that use practical rules or strategies to guide decision-making and problem-solving. They are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution but aim to provide a satisfactory solution within a reasonable timeframe.

## Types of Heuristic Techniques 🎨🧠

1. **Greedy Heuristics** 🌟🧠
   - **Meaning**: 🧠 Make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
   - **Usage**: 🚀 Applied in optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem.

2. **Simulated Annealing** 🌡️🧠
   - **Objective**: 🧠 Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, it explores solution spaces and accepts less optimal solutions to escape local optima.
   - **Application**: 🚀 Used in combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.

3. **Genetic Algorithms** 🧬🧠
   - **Meaning**: 🧠 Mimics the process of natural selection to evolve a population of potential solutions toward an optimal solution.
   - **Usage**: 🚀 Applied in optimization, search, and machine learning problems.

4. **Tabu Search** 📜❌🧠
   - **Objective**: 🧠 Avoid revisiting recently explored solutions, preventing cycles in the search space.
   - **Application**: 🚀 Commonly used in combinatorial optimization problems.
