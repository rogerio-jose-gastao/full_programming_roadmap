   - **Meaning**: 📏 Measures the total number of lines of code in the software.
   - **Usage**: 🚀 Commonly used for traditional waterfall projects.

2. **Function Points (FP)** 🎯📏
   - **Objective**: 📏 Quantifies the functionality delivered by a software application.
   - **Benefits**: 🚀 Independent of programming language and technology.

3. **Story Points** 📖📏
   - **Meaning**: 📏 Represents the relative size and complexity of user stories.
   - **Usage**: 🚀 Frequently used in Agile and Scrum methodologies.

4. **Use Case Points (UCP)** 🔄📏
   - **Objective**: 📏 Quantifies the functionality based on use cases and actors.
   - **Benefits**: 🚀 Provides a holistic view of system interactions.

## Estimation Techniques 🎯📏

1. **Expert Judgment** 🧠📏
   - **Meaning**: 📏 Involves input from experienced team members or industry experts.
   - **Usage**: 🚀 Initial estimation in the absence of historical data.

2. **Comparative Estimation** ⚖️📏
   - **Objective**: 📏 Compares the current project with similar past projects.
   - **Benefits**: 🚀 Useful when historical data is available.

3. **Parametric Estimation** 🎚️📏
   - **Meaning**: 📏 Utilizes statistical relationships between variables.
   - **Usage**: 🚀 Useful for large-scale projects with diverse characteristics.
